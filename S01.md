## Indentation

`print('Hello World')`

## Variable definition

Variables are containers for storing data values.

**Creating Variables**

Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

## Casting

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

## Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:

* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

### Multi Words Variable Names

Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

**Camel Case**

Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

`myVariableName = "John"`

**Pascal Case**

Each word starts with a capital letter:

`MyVariableName = "John"`

**Snake Case**

Each word is separated by an underscore character:

`my_variable_name = "John"`
